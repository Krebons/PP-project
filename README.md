Student admission using business rules.

Use bussiness rule to decide if a student is admissed into the university and wheather or not they are eligible for any type of scholarship.

The student will be able to enter his informations into an application wizard(name,address,email,telephone,grades). This information will be stored into a database in order to keep track of every student.

The application will determine which students will be admissed into the University, generating a list containing all admissions.

It will also generate a list with all the students that have won any specific type of scholarships.

Deliverables:
